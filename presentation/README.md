# CSC 490: Final Presentation

## Objective

This final presentation should teach to an audience of masters-level graduate students something that you learned throughout this project. It focuses on the following course-level learning outcomes:

 4. Describe some basic concepts related to the intersection of computer graphics, spatial data processing, and parallel computing

It will be instructive to consider what you learned in this course that was not apparent in previous courses that you took (e.g., CSC 360), making reference to primary sources that were introduced in this course (CSC 490).


## Specifications

You should prepare and deliver a 10-15 minute presentation to a live audience. The style of the presentation is at your discretion; it could, for example, involve: a code walk-through, a slide deck, an interactive demo, and/or a live coding session. In particular, it should:

  * describe some technique or lesson or deliverable that you got out of this project
  * engage the audience

A strong presentation will engage the audience and provoke them to ask interesting questions afterwards. A fifteen minute question period will follow the presentation in which you will be asked questions in the style of a master's thesis defense, such as to clarify technical aspects.

## Evaluation

The presentation will be graded subjectively by the instructor according to three equally-weighted criteria, each described below. A score of 75% indicates that the statement is true of three quarters of audience members.

  1. **Audience Questions**: The researchers attending the presentation are able to ask detailed, interesting questions based on the content provided in the presentation
  2. **Response to Questions**: The presenter's response to the questions is thoughtful and well reasoned and adequately satisfies the questioner
  3. **Audience Learning**: The instructor perceives that the audience has learned something meaningful from the presentation

## Due Date

The presentation will occur at 13:00 UTC-7, Monday 21 August 2023; there is a grace period of **fifteen minutes** during which a late presentation will still be considered to be on time.
